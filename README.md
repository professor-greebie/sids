# SIDS - An Actor Model Approach to Data Collection in RUST

This is an experimental actor-model system library built in rust. The repository has a few Mermaid diagrams 
and exxamples available for you to examine if you are interested in implementing the approach yourself.

## Getting Started

Run the example logging demonstration.

```
git clone https://github.com/professor-greebie/sids
cd sids
cargo run --example logger
```
